# Discord Bot Project
This is a small project with the intention to add some functionality to a small game server on Discord with a Bot. This is the first of a list of projects to train the use of Python.

The project is still on it's early phase. There are two features so far:
- Sending a _Welcome Message_ to a member who joins the server;
- Checking if the Starcraft II version changed through the ```!sc2_version``` command.

## Learning the Tools
These are the main sources I used to learn the tools that were totally new to me before starting this project:
- Programming a Discord Bot: [Article _from RealPython_](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) 
- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: [YouTube Video _from Corey Schafer_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k)
